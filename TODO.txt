From highest priority to lowest:

 * Upon auto-removal, we should remove allowed-sender-ness as well as
   subscription. This is a bug in OpenCore as well (and is actually
   much more problematic there than here, since it's conceivably a 
   project security hole if a malicious member is booted from the 
   project -- here it's just clutter since there'll be a crufty reference
   to a nonexistent member. oh, well, it might be a security hole if a
   new member joins with the same id as the deleted member.)
 * Flunc tests
 * Set default list manager
 * Make ISyncWithProjectMembership toggleable
 * Make this whole package go away -- really it only needs to exist
   b/c there's no uniform interface for "fetching all members of the
   current micro-site-thingie (e.g. portal,project) so we need separate
   event subscribers. Also we need to use a different default list type
   (PostModerated instead of Discussion) but that could also be abstracted
   easily enough
