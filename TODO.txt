From highest priority to lowest:

 * #2851
 * turn ./ftests/script.txt into flunc tests
 * Set default list manager(s)
 * Make ISyncWithProjectMembership toggleable
 * should ISyncWithProjectMembership also automap admins<->moderators?
 * Make this whole package go away -- really it only needs to exist
   b/c there's no uniform interface for "fetching all members of the
   current micro-site-thingie (e.g. portal,project) so we need separate
   event subscribers. Also we need to use a different default list type
   (PostModerated instead of Discussion) but that could also be abstracted
   easily enough
