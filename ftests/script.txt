This is an informal testing script to be turned into automated flunc tests.

add sitewide lists

verify topnav:
 find "Mailing Lists":  / /people /projects /news/*
 notfind "Mailing Lists":  /people/* /projects/*
  .. except a IListenFeatureletInstalled project will have a *different* "Mailing Lists" link

non-admins get /lists/ redirected to default list (iff there is only one list, which there should be at first, automagically); admins don't

flex ISyncWithProjectMembership (and maybe verify it doesn't happen for newly created lists)

verify list type
 * are we allowed to create a non-post-moderated list? i don't know about this.

remove sitewide lists
